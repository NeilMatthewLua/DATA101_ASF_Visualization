Good afternoon Vince, Aaron

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accomplish the following:
 - Tell us your favorite items 
    - open favorite_items.txt
    - on every category, put your surname and your favorite item (i.e. Lua:LUnicorns)
 - Leave a quote for our group this term 
    - create a file in the ff format ("surname_quote.txt")
    - inside the txt file, leave a quote that you'd like to share to the group

Guidelines:
 - Branch out from this current branch (lua/vince-aaron-task)
 - Name your branch in this format (surname/word-word-more-words) <- this will be our official way to do it
 - Once done, commit, publish the branch, and make a pull request back to this branch and request kurt to perform the checking 
 - Once kurt approves it, you have successfully accomplished this task fellow prodigies.

Reminders:
 - Dont forget to always pull (Repository->pull) or Fetch origin first before starting
 - Be descriptive on your commit messages/titles 
 - Double check where you're branching off of first
 - Double check where you're making a pull request to
